All in vanilla : HTML, CSS, JS, PHP.
Just copy all files on you device. You must have a PHP environment if you want to use the 'Contact' section and send an email. 
Everything else is directly usable in your browser on your localhost.

I have selected 17 projects (for the moment) where I have used HTML/CSS, vanilla JavaScript, CMS, JS Frameworks (React and Express), all done from 2002 to now. I will add to it as new projects come up.
